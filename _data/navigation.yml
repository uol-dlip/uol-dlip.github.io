# This file contains the main site navigation.
#
# There are four main navigation areas:
#
#   quicklinks - these are the menus at the top of the page in the black header
#   main - this is the main menu shown below the black header
#   section - this is a menu which can be turned on and off for different pages and can be used for contextual navigation
#   footer - the footer has three menu areas in columns and another in the bottom band of the site
#
# All navigation items have a title and either have an items collection (for a nested menu) or a url
